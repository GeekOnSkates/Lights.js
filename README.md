## Merry Christmas!

This library is a set of programmable Christmas lights for your website.
I would love to do real ones someday, but that's not for everyone.  So I
wanted to create something anyone can use to spread a little Christmas
cheer.  I'm excited to see what I can do with this library, and expect
it to grow and change and improve every year.

By the way, if you don't celebrate Christmas, I don't mean to leave you
out.  I'd gladly wish you a happy Hannukah, happy Kwanzaa or whatever
else you may be celebrating.  But in my country, we've the urge to not
exclude anybody has gotten so intense that "merry Christmas" has become
some kind of twisted political thing.  I don't really agree with that,
and wanted to wish a merry Christmas to everyone who celebrates it.

So merry Christmas, happy holiday, and happy coding!  :)
